# Day 2: Compound Event Probability

### Task

There are 3 urns labeled x, y, and z. 

- Urn x contains 4 red balls and 3 black balls.
- Urn y contains 5 red balls and 4 black balls.
- Urn z contains 4 red balls and 4 black balls. 

One ball is drawn from each of the 3 urns. What is the probability that, of the balls 3 drawn, 2 are red and 1 is black?
